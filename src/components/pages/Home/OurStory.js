        <p>
          Welcome to Little Lemon, where tradition meets flavor in every bite.
          Nestled in the heart of the city, our family-owned Mediterranean bistro has been serving up fresh, vibrant dishes inspired by generations of authentic recipes.
          Founded by two brothers with a passion for hospitality and wholesome food, Little Lemon is more than a restaurantâ€”it's a warm, welcoming space where every meal is made with love, and every guest is treated like family.
          Come for the food. Stay for the experience.
